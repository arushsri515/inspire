# Inspire (NSPR)
Inspire is a cryptocurrency that was built to inspire people to donate to causes. The Inspire Token operates on Binance Smart Chain and is a BEP20 standard token.
# Usage
To start your journey with Inspire, head over to your favorite cryptocurrency wallet and buy some NSPR. To add the BSC network to Metamask, follow these instructions.

**Usage with Metamask**
Metamask is one of the most famous cryptocurrency wallets today. However, it is an Ethereum wallet, so we must add the Binance Smart Chain to it.
